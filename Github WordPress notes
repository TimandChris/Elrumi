Github WordPress notes

1. create organization
-a. give it a name
-b. add owners
-c. good to go.

2. Create an empty repo on GIT DO NOT! initialize with readme.md file

3. Initialize GIT on your project, on your computer

[
git init (create repo)
git status
(create ignore file for node_modules)
git add -A
git commit -m ""

after getting link from git at quick setup page
git remote add upstream 'url'
git remote -v (should see upstream)
git push upstream master

now we should have timjackwilkins/whatever the name of repo is

git remote add origin 'url'
]

4. Pick one person to push the initial commit to tthe origin files
-a. this person should add the files: git add -A
-b. this person should commit the files:
-c. this person should add the organization repo as their upstream now.
-d. Push files up to the organization GitHub: git push upstream master


5. Everyone fork the repo so that they have a copy of their own. We never need to to
push origin master again.

6. Add remote for origin on YOUR computer IF you were the first to push.
	-git remote add origin <YOURurl>
a. 	set up the upstream
	git remote add upstream <orgURL>

7. Clone the repo if you do not have the files on your repo yet!
	git clone	

8. Start Working and follow these steps
-a. When you are ready to commit, check the status of the repo
b. Add files you want to commit
